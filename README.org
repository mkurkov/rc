* Overview

Author: Mikl Kurkov (mkurkov@gmail.com)

This is my personal development environment setup.
It uses Ansible for provisioning new development machine and consist of

- Ubuntu (15.04)
- XMonad (tiling WM)
- Ansible (used for provisioning new machine)
- Git
- Emacs (with many packets from ELPA)
- Erlang (main working language)
- Haskell (side projects)
- J (jsoftware.com - prototyping/power calculator)
- Latex (+ PGF/TikZ for graphics)
- PostgreSQL
- VirtualBox (mostly for some Windows apps)
- Docker
- KeepassX (for passwords/secrets keeping)
- Dropbox
- tmux (advanced shell multiplexor)
- urxvt (advanced terminal)
- Solarized color theme (shell and emacs)
- Firefox+Vimperator (multiple instances for different spaces - work,home,test)
- Google Chrome (for some sites that need it)

* Setup

> sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt-get install ansible git-core
> git clone https://github.com/mkurkov/rc
> cd rc
Edit ansible/inventory (user full name, email)
> ./install.sh

* Usage

After provisioning it should made next changes to OS:

- Install needed packages
- Change switching layout hotkey to Both Shifts
- Swap ALT <-> CTRL
- Set PrtSc to Win (for Thinkpad keyboard)
- Add Xmonad session entry to login screen
- Setup dotfiles in home dir for different apps

** Xmonad
** Tmux
