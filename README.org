* Overview

Author: Mikl Kurkov (mkurkov@gmail.com)

This is my personal development environment setup.
It uses Ansible for provisioning new development machine and consists of

- Ubuntu (16.04)
- XMonad (tiling WM)
- Ansible (used for provisioning new machine)
- Git
- Emacs (with many packets from ELPA)
- Erlang (main working language)
- Haskell (side projects)
- J (jsoftware.com - prototyping/power calculator)
- Latex (+ PGF/TikZ for graphics)
- PostgreSQL
- VirtualBox (mostly for some Windows apps)
- Docker
- KeepassX (for passwords/secrets keeping)
- Dropbox
- tmux (advanced shell multiplexor)
- urxvt (advanced terminal)
- Solarized color theme (shell and emacs)

* Setup

Install Ubuntu 16.04

- sudo apt-get update
- sudo apt-get install ansible git-core
- git clone https://github.com/mkurkov/rc
- cd rc

Edit ansible/inventory (user full name, email)
Tweak ansible/main.yml roles
 ./install.sh

This will install XMonad and configure Gnome to keep only top-level menu.
Add applets to top menubar (ALT-RightClick). I use Main Menu and Indicator Complete applets.

* Usage

After provisioning it should made next changes to OS:

- Install needed packages
- Change switching layout hotkey to Both Shifts
- Swap ALT <-> CTRL
- Add Xmonad session entry to login screen
- Setup emacs (will load additional packages on first run)

** Xmonad
** Tmux
** Emacs
